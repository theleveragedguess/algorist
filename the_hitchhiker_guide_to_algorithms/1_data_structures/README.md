# Data Structures

## Dictionaries

__Input description__: A set of $n$ records, each identified by one or more key fields.  
__Problem description__: Build and maintain a data structure to efficiently locate, insert, and delete the record associated with any query key $q$.

## Priority Queues

__Input description__: A set of records with numerically or otherwise totally-ordered keys.  
__Problem description__: Build and maintain a data structure for providing quick access to the smallest or largest key in the set.

## Suffix Trees and Arrays

__Input description__: A reference string $S$.  
__Problem description__: Build a data structure to quickly find all places where an arbitrary query string $q$ occurs in $S$.

## Graph Data Structures

__Input description__: A graph $G$.  
__Problem description__: Represent the graph $G$ using a flexible, efficient data structure.

## Set Data Structures

__Input description__: A universe of items $U = \lbrace u_1,...,u_n \rbrace$ on which is defined a collection of subsets $S = \lbrace S_1,...,S_m \rbrace$.  
__Problem description__: Represent each subset so as to efficiently (1) test whether $u_i \in S_j$, (2) compute the union or intersection of $S_i$ and $S_j$, and (3) insert or delete members of $S$.

## Kd-Trees

__Input description__: A set $S$ of $n$ points or more complicated geometric objects in $k$ dimensions.  
__Problem description__: Construct a tree that partitions space by half-planes such that each object is contained in its own box-shaped region.

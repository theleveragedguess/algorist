**Input description**: A set $S$ of lines and line segments $l_1,...,l_n$ or a pair of polygons or polyhedra $P_1$ and $P_2$.  
**Problem description**: Which pairs of line segments intersect each other? What is the intersection of $P_1$ and $P_2$?

## Bin Packing

**Input description**: A set of $n$ items with sizes $d_1,...,d_n$. A set of $m$ bins with capacity $c_1,...,c_m$.  
**Problem description**: Store all the items using the smallest number of bins.

## Medial-Axis Transform

**Input description**: A polygon or polyhedron $P$.  
**Problem description**: What are the set of points within $P$ that have more than one closest point on the boundary of $P$?

## Polygon Partitioning

**Input description**: A polygon or polyhedron $P$.  
**Problem description**: Partition $P$ into a small number of simple (typically convex) pieces.

## Simplifying Polygons

**Input description**: A polygon or polyhedron $p$, with $n$ vertices.  
**Problem description**: Find a polygon or polyhedron $p'$ containing only $n'$ vertices, such that the shape of $p'$ is as close as possible to $p$.

**Problem description**: How similar are $P_1$ and $P_2$?

## Motion Planning

**Input description**: A polygonal-shaped robot starting in a given position $s$ in a room containing polygonal obstacles, and a goal position $t$.  
**Problem description**: Find the shortest route taking $s$ to $t$ without intersecting any obstacles.

## Maintaining Line Arrangements

**Input description**: A set of lines and line segments $l_1,...,l_n$.

## Minkowski Sum

**Input description**: Point sets or polygons $A$ and $B$, containing $n$ and $m$ vertices respectively.  
**Problem description**: What is the convolution of $A$ and $B$â€”i.e. , the Minkowski $\sum{A + B = \lbrace x + y | x \in A,y \in B\rbrace}$?

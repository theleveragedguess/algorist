# Graph Problems: Polynomial-Time

## Connected Components

__Input description__: A directed or undirected graph $G$.  
__Problem description__: Identify the different pieces or components of $G$, where vertices $x$ and y are members of different components if no path exists from $x$ to $y$ in $G$.  

## Topological Sorting

__Input description__: A directed acyclic graph $G =(V,E)$, also known as a _partial order_ or _poset_.  
__Problem description__: Find a linear ordering of the vertices of $V$ such that for each edge $(i,j) \in E$, vertex $i$ is to the left of vertex $j$.

## Minimum Spanning Tree

__Input description__: A graph $G =(V,E)$ with weighted edges.  
__Problem description__: The minimum weight subset of edges $E' \subset E$ that form a tree on V.

## Shortest Path

__Input description__: An edge-weighted graph $G$, with vertices $s$ and $t$.  
__Problem description__: Find the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ in $G$.

## Transitive Closure and Reduction

__Input description__: A directed graph $G =(V,E)$.  
__Problem description__: For _transitive closure_, construct a graph $G' =(V,E')$ with edge $(i,j) \in E'$ iff there is a directed path from $i$ to $j$ in $G$. For _transitive reduction_, construct a small graph $G' =(V,E')$ with a directed path from $i$ to $j$ in G' iï¬€ there is a directed path from $i$ to $j$ in $G$.

## Matching

__Input description__: A (weighted) graph $G =(V,E)$.  
__Problem description__: Find the largest set of edges $E'$ from $E$ such that each vertex in $V$ is incident to at most one edge of E'.

## Eulerian Cycle/Chinese Postman

__Input description__: A graph $G =(V,E)$.  
__Problem description__: Find the shortest tour visiting each edge of $G$ at least once.

## Edge and Vertex Connectivity

__Input description__: A graph $G$. Optionally, a pair of vertices $s$ and $t$.  
__Problem description__: What is the smallest subset of vertices (or edges) whose deletion will disconnect $G$? Or which will separate $s$ from $t$?

## Network Flow

__Input description__: A directed graph $G$, where each edge $e =(i,j)$ has a capacity $c_e$. A source node $s$ and sink node $t$.  
__Problem description__: What is the maximum flow you can route from $s$ to $t$ while respecting the capacity constraint of each edge?

## Drawing Graphs Nicely

__Input description__: A graph $G$.  
__Problem description__: Draw a graph $G$ so as to accurately reflect its structure.

## Drawing Trees

__Input description__: A tree $T$, which is a graph without any cycles.  
__Problem description__: Create a nice drawing of the tree $T$.

## Planarity Detection and Embedding

__Input description__: A graph $G$.  
__Problem description__: Can $G$ be drawn in the plane such that no two edges cross? If so, produce such a drawing.
